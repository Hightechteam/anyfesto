--------A platform from which to speak from

The idea of this project is to use the low cost RaspberryPi to host
tools that allow you to speak. these tools will include the ability
to broadcast over FM (prerecorded and mic input), to share files over 
wifi, to communicate with others via several methods (wifi, bluetooth, 
display)..

These tools should be easy to config and run. 

In my mind this would be used at rallies, gatherings, meetups and  
in public spaces...the reasons....vast. From a group of friends 
meeting up for lunch to a poltical rally in a less than friendly 
area...

So as not so spin the stack up to the moon and get nothing done this 
document will set goal based on some sort of reasoned measure.

Phase 0 - Gather base code for RPi Distro

Phase 1 - Customise PiFM and Piratebox into the distro

Phase 2 - Secure msging



Phase x - Hardware. Making a case and battery solution that is 
          inexpensive yet reliable.

Phase y - Secure backhaul to the intertubes (gsm, cell, wifi, etc)
          It should be as secure and anonymous (they are both realtive
          scales and not absolutes) as needed.
