..        ANYFESTO - A platform from which to speak      ..
..-------------------------------------------------------..

[X] - Gather base code for RPi Distro

[X] - Customise PiFM into the distro

[ ] - Customise Pirate/Librarybox into the distro

[ ] - Secure msging (need a good crypted msgs service here) 

[X] - IRCd-Hybrid server installed and configured into the distro

[ ] - Service discovery (avahi, ssid, fm, display)


[ ]  - Meshing. Use of a second wifi device to mesh with other Anyfesto
          boxen. Two flavors - Open and Trusted. 
	    Open - no auth needed
            Trusted - use of keys and/or CoT 
          Add mutual links to Piratebox shares, fm freqs and the 
          ability to pass msgs. 

[ ] - Hardware. Making a case and battery solution that is 
          inexpensive yet reliable. Include such things as a 
          GPIO based kill switch (shutdown, reboot clean, scrub).

[ ]  - Secure backhaul to the intertubes (gsm, cell, wifi, etc)
          It should be as secure and anonymous (they are both realtive
          scales and not absolutes) as needed.
