..        ANYFESTO - A platform from which to speak      ..
..-------------------------------------------------------..


The idea of this project is to use the low cost RaspberryPi as device that 
allows you to speak. Tools and methods will be added to the RPi.
These tools give the operator the ability to broadcast over FM 
(prerecorded and mic input), to share files over  wifi, to communicate 
with others via several methods (wifi, bluetooth, display)..

These tools should be easy to config and run. Best case, an easy setup 
script via https or ssh. Everything included should be configurable 
from this. At best, no one HAS to go monkey in the code. The option
will always be there to do that...lets face it..that is how I like it.
But this is not just for me. 

In my mind this would be used at rallies, gatherings, meetups and  
in public spaces...the reasons....vast. From a group of friends 
meeting up for lunch to a poltical rally in a less than friendly 
area...

So as not to spin the stack up to the moon and get nothing done this 
document will set goals based on some sort of reasoned measure.

Phase 0 - Gather base code for RPi Distro

Phase 1 - Customise PiFM and Piratebox into the distro

Phase 2 - Secure msging

Phase 3 - Prove the use of what we have so far. Get interest in it.
          At this point the user facing website and GUI aspects should
          be worked on. 



Phase x - Hardware. Making a case and battery solution that is 
          inexpensive yet reliable. Include such things as a 
          GPIO based kill switch (shutdown, reboot clean, scrub).

Phase y - Secure backhaul to the intertubes (gsm, cell, wifi, etc)
          It should be as secure and anonymous (they are both realtive
          scales and not absolutes) as needed. 

Phase z - Roll all things learned into an Anyfesto Distro. Propigate
          and maintain.
