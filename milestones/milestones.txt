..        ANYFESTO - A platform from which to speak      ..
..-------------------------------------------------------..

[X] - Gather base code for RPi Distro

[X] - Customise PiFM into the distro

[ ] - Customise Pirate/Librarybox into the distro
     
     [X] First, get it working on the RPi. Fix Hostapd issues
     [ ] Mod the theme, graphics, etc.
      
[ ] - Secure msging (need a good crypted msgs service here) 

[X] - IRCd-Hybrid server installed and configured into the distro

[X] - Video streaming to the local net (multicast, http, rtsp)

[X] - Service discovery (avahi, ssid, fm, display)

[ ] - Create a unified web front end for configuration and running all of the above
       [x] - Bootstrap framework 
       [ ] - Theme, Banners, Headers and Footers
       [X] - Radio Control (on/off, freq, shuffle, repeat, mic, add links/files)
       [X] - IRCd Control  (on/off, klines)
       [X] - IRC User Web page (webbased irc)
       [X] - Video Streming Control (on/off. repeat, playlist)
       [X] - Landing page for the captive portal
            (need to think about doing a config page to set this page up
               so it can be reconfiged on the fly for specific events)
   
[ ]  - Meshing. Use of a second wifi device to mesh with other Anyfesto
          boxen. Two flavors - Open and Trusted. 
	    Open - no auth needed
            Trusted - use of keys and/or CoT 
          Add mutual links to Piratebox shares, fm freqs and the 
          ability to pass msgs. 

[ ] - Hardware. Making a case and battery solution that is 
          inexpensive yet reliable. Include such things as a 
          GPIO based kill switch (shutdown, reboot clean, scrub).

[ ]  - Secure backhaul to the intertubes (gsm, cell, wifi, etc)
          It should be as secure and anonymous (they are both realtive
          scales and not absolutes) as needed.
