Yep, this is starting to build up from an idea to functional to usable. Stay tuned.

Some points
  I want to set this up as something you can build on a USB flash drive or SD card and boot into when you 
  want to use your Chromebook as a shared resource. Some Chromebooks' bios allow you to boot to usb device, some 
  do not...mine did not. This link fixed that   http://johnlewis.ie/

  I ran the base install script minus some PI centric bits on a fresh debian environ living on a USB stick. Hostap is needing some 
  loving with the hammer of justice and the directory structure needs fixing up. But, yeah, this might be doable. More as it happens.

   Some things of note:
   -I am using Debian 9 to install the OS onto a USB flash drive. You can use an SD or even a USB HD. 
   - When installing Debian 9 create a user named  "anyfesto" The scripts are set up for that username
   - As you are installing Debain 9 you can choose whatever GUI you want for your desktop. I like XFCE as
      it is slim yet expressive. Your milage will vary, the choice of GUIS will be offered to during install
   - And yes this means while your Chromebook is booked into this you will have a full Desktop Linux to
     do as you want. I'm finding this very useful. 
   - Debian 9 has an issue with SUDO, I will document what needs doing to get it fixed or script a fix if I can

 ToDO
   X Chromebook BIOS fix to boot from USB/SD http://johnlewis.ie/
   X Debian base
   - Make the current scripts work with the Chromebook
   - KAlite (http://ka-lite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installguide/install_all.html#ubuntu-debian-deb)
   - Ability to add a second wifi radio and get internet connection but  wall it off from captiveportal users
