Some points
  I want to set this up as something you can build on a USB flaskdrive or SD card and boot into when you 
  want to use your Chromebook as a shared resource. Some Chromebooks' bios allow you to boot to usb device, some 
  do not...mine did not. This link fixed that   http://johnlewis.ie/

  I ran the base install script minus some PI centric bits on a fresh debian environ living on a USB stick. Hostap is needing some 
  loving with the hammer of justice and the directory structure needs fixing up. But, yeah, this might be doable. More as it happens.
