#ANYFESTO - A platform from which to speak 


The Raspberry Pi/CHIP as total communication device: Audio streamer, file server, p2p communicator, education server and more.  
Intallation guides and eventual automated scripts for several low cost hardware setups.

Any manifestation of a meeting - in the schools or in the streets - is going to need clear communication.  
Anyfesto is the toolbox to make that happen.
