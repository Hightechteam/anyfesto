Working with the ne Raspberrian Jessie... Everything listed in the Install doc is working sav for the PIFM module. PiFM does not work with the multicore PIs.

Testing out a few FM  replacements including the Fm  Transmitter  board sold by Adafruit.
No clear winner yet.

Calibre is a bit of a CPU hog. Looking at another solution  ( https://github.com/seblucas/cops)

Webmin is a damn handy  thing to have on board. I am seeing this as a way to do maintence  tasks wither  first hand or by others who are not shell ready. 

VLC as audio streamer is golden. Lattest build works  well, can deal with multiple connections and so far has been up and streaming for 2 days with no noticable burps.

Added a 2tb USB drive to the test rig. Mounting via fstab caused it to  crash at times, running the mount in a startup script works all the time.
