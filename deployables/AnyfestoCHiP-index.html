			<h2>About AnyfestoCHIP</h2>
			<p>AnyfestoCHIP is a  handy CHIP based server that fits in a pocket. It is battery powered and uses wifi to let others connect to it. AnyfestoCHIP serves up ebooks and files via a web interface, a stream of audio you can listen to with your favorite music player and other services like voice and text chat. Inspired by pirate radio and the free culture movement, it uses Free, Libre and Open Source software (FLOSS) to create a mobile wireless file sharing network where users can anonymously share images, video, audio, documents, and other digital content.</p>
			<p>Anyfesto is designed to be safe and secure. No logins are required and no user data is logged. The system is purposely not connected to the Internet in order to prevent tracking and preserve user privacy. AnyfestoCHIP is built using VLC, Lighttp, and runs on Debian Linux</p>
                        <p>If you would like to build your own AnyfestoCHIP go to <a href="https://github.com/tomhiggins/anyfesto/blob/master/installCHIP">this page on GitHub</a> to learn how.</p>
